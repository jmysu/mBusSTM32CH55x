/*
  ButtonMouseControl

  For STM32 based board with USB capabilities

  Controls the mouse from five pushbuttons.

  Hardware:
  - five pushbuttons attached to D2, D3, D4, D5, D6

  The mouse movement is always relative. This sketch reads four pushbuttons,
  and uses them to set the movement of the mouse.

  WARNING: When you use the Mouse.move() command, the Arduino takes over your
  mouse! Make sure you have control before you use the mouse commands.
